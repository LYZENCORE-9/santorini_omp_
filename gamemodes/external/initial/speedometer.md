# Speedometer Textdraw Documentation

## Overview
This documentation outlines the implementation of a speedometer textdraw in Pawn for a gamemode. The speedometer displays the speed of players' vehicles in kilometers per hour (km/h) using a textdraw.

## Features
- Creates a player-specific textdraw to display the vehicle speed.
- Updates the speedometer textdraw dynamically based on the player's vehicle speed.
- Shows or hides the speedometer textdraw based on the player's state (driver or not).

## Code Structure

### Textdraw Creation
- `OnPlayerConnect`: Creates a player-specific textdraw for the speedometer upon player connection.

### Updating Speedometer
- `OnPlayerUpdate`: Updates the speedometer textdraw dynamically based on the player's vehicle speed. Shows or hides the textdraw accordingly.
- `OnPlayerStateChange`: Shows or hides the speedometer textdraw based on the player's state change.

### Utility Function
- `GetVehicleSpeed`: Calculates the speed of a vehicle in km/h based on its velocity.

## Usage
1. The speedometer textdraw is automatically created for each player upon connection.
2. The textdraw dynamically updates to display the vehicle speed when the player is in the driver state.
3. Customize the appearance and positioning of the speedometer textdraw as needed.

## Notes
- Ensure compatibility with the YSI Coding library version specified.
- Customize textdraw appearance, positioning, and update frequency according to game design preferences.
- Consider additional features or enhancements to the speedometer functionality, such as units conversion or vehicle-specific customization.
